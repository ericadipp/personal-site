# Intro

I am vegetarian, programmer and problem solver. I practice my skills almost every day and strive to be my prime/best. My current primary interests are 'Data Science' and 'Software Engineering'.

I check interesting projects on the web in the mean time.One such one I found is 'Gitstats'. I am particularly interested in social impact, education. I teach some of my class mates some technologies I am comfortable with. I am based in Hyderabad, Telangana, India.
